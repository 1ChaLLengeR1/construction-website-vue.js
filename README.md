# Project idea:
###### The idea for the website was to build a visual website for the client, but unfortunately the client gave up on the idea. This Project was supposed to be a simple showcase. While writing, I decided that I would add a simple backend based on node.js to learn something more than just the frontend.

# Technologies:
### Frontend:
- Vue.js
- Vuex
- Vue Router
- CSS/SCSS
### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- JWT
- Postgresql 14
### DevOps
- Nginx
- My VPS for hosting -> hosting: ovh.pl
- Linux

## Conclusion
##### In retrospect, the project was very simple, but it was complete enough to allow me to create websites with a full user panel + CRUD + Photos.
